**Precompiled binaries are available for Windows, Linux and macOS.**

"Precompiled binaries" are the compiled version of the source code which is ready to run on your system.
It is a convenient way to install the software without the need to compile it from source code.
Do not run binaries from untrusted sources.

For download, please visit the [releases page](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/releases).

If you don't see the precompiled binaries for your platform, you can always build from source code.

>**NOTE**: We recommended building our software from source code directly, 
to be up-to-date but also to prevent having to trust a third party which could be a vector of attacks later.<br/>
>A comprehensive guide to build from source code is available [here](/getting-started/build).
