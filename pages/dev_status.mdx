# Development Status

A very crude table about the development status of the XELIS project.
It is updated whenever a new task is added or the status of an existing task changes.
This list does NOT include all internal tasks, bug fixes, maintenance, minor enhancements, etc.; 
it simply provides a general overview of the XELIS development state.
For more in-depth history about the work we do, check out the [Github project page](https://github.com/xelis-project).
